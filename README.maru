This is a fork of the Linux Containers (LXC) project for Maru OS.

The main build config for integrating LXC into Maru OS can be found in the
toplevel Android.mk file. Most of the custom coniguration to support LXC in an
Android-based environment can be found there.

Modifications to LXC source code are kept to a bare minimum and are made with
upstreaming in mind.

For more info on LXC, please see the README and the LXC project website
https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/.
